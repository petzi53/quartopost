# quartopost


<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of `quartopost` is to create and open a Quarto blog post in RStudio. 

`quartopost()` displays a dialog window where you can enter the data for the YAML header of a new blog post. 

```{r screenshot, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Dialog window for creating a blog post', fig.alt='Dialog windows shows input field for title, author, date and subtitle'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-/shiny-dialog-window.png")
```

After clicking the "Done" button the function generates the core skeleton of a Quarto post. This includes: 

- creating the directory (named with the date and title in kebab notation) 
- (optionally) copying images from your hard disk into this new folder
- creating the `index.qmd` file with the YAML header populated from the data of the dialog window
- opening the blog post file in RStudio for editing.

You can choose from your categories already created or add new categories. With the package comes also an RStudio Addin so you can bind the `quartopost()` with a shortcut.
